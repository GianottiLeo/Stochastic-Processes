# Stochastic-Process
Projects developed during my course in USP SME0805

Stochastic processes are mathematical models used to describe systems that evolve randomly over time. Unlike deterministic processes, where we have a distribution or a function do predict que future values, since they are already set by the initial conditions.
Here, everything involves randomness or uncertainty, so we need to add this aspect in our code, using probabilistic laws, to try to predict the likelihood of transitioning from one state to another.

Stochastic processes find major applications in finance, but it is used in a lot of fields, since randomness plays a significant role in modeling real-world phenomena. They provide a powerful framework for analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex systems under uncertainty.

During the course, we learned a lot of Python and used the Numpy library a lot to create graphs and calculations like this one
